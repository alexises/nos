//! Applies an interface's desired state to the real OS (or a stand-in).
//!
//! `nos-interfaced` never creates interfaces (see `CLAUDE.md`'s scope
//! section) — a driver only ever configures ones that already exist in the
//! netns. `NoopInterfaceDriver` (today's log-only behavior) is the
//! platform-agnostic default; `LinuxInterfaceDriver` is the real `rtnetlink`
//! implementation, selected via `--driver` in `main.rs`. This split exists
//! so a future non-Linux/hardware backend can be added without touching
//! `state.rs`/`reconcile.rs`.
