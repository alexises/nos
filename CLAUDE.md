# NOS — Network Operating System

A network operating system built from scratch in Rust.

## Components

| Directory | Crate | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `proto/` | `nos-proto` | Shared wire types, IPC codec — single source of truth for all inter-process contracts |
| `config/` | `nos-config` | Configuration store and IPC server |
| `bgp/` | `nos-bgp` | BGP-4 implementation |
| `cli/` | `nos-cli` | Interactive shell (binary `nos`) — main user-facing entry point |

## Architecture

### Process model

Each component (BGP, RIB, OSPF, …) runs as a dedicated OS process. No component shares memory with another.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  nos-config process                                  │
│  ConfigStore (named transactions/running) + IPC      │
│  Listens on: /run/nos/config.sock                    │
└───────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                        │ Unix socket (nos-proto wire protocol)
          ┌─────────────┼─────────────┬─────────────┐
          ▼             ▼             ▼             ▼
    nos-bgp         nos-rib       nos-ospf       nos-cli
    process         process       process        (shell)
    (future)        (future)
```

### IPC transport

**Transport:** Unix domain sockets (`tokio::net::UnixListener` / `UnixStream`).  
**Serialization:** `postcard` (binary, compact, serde-based, no-alloc capable).  
**Framing:** 4-byte little-endian length prefix + postcard payload (see `nos-proto::codec::IpcCodec`).

This gives maximum performance for intra-host IPC with full Rust type safety — no HTTP overhead, no IDL outside the type system.

### Protocol spec sync

All wire types live in `nos-proto`. Since every component imports its message types from there, changing a type causes a **compile error in every consumer immediately** — stronger than protobuf's silent field-drop. This is the mechanism that keeps all processes in sync.

### Dependency graph

```
nos-proto   (no NOS dependencies)
    ↑               ↑
nos-config      nos-bgp, nos-rib, nos-ospf, nos-cli, …
(server)        (clients)
```

Component crates depend on `nos-proto` for types and `nos-proto::IpcCodec` for the framing codec. They do **not** depend on `nos-config` internals.

### Config subscription protocol

```
Client → Server:
  Request::Get                 one-shot read of the current running config
  Request::Subscribe           receive current snapshot + all future commits
  Request::Unsubscribe         stop receiving updates (connection stays open)
  Request::Save                persist the current running config to disk
  Request::OpenTransaction     open (or resume) a named transaction from blank/current
  Request::ApplyOp             apply one edit (e.g. a BgpInstanceOp) to a named transaction
  Request::GetTransaction      one-shot read of a named transaction's in-progress config
  Request::CommitTransaction   validate, promote to running, broadcast, and delete the transaction
  Request::DiscardTransaction  delete a named transaction without touching running config

Server → Client:
  Event::Config(Config)             config snapshot (initial + on every commit, incl. via a transaction commit)
  Event::Error(String)              error from the daemon
  Event::Saved                      confirms the running config was persisted (reply to Save)
  Event::Transaction(Snapshot)      a named transaction's current state (reply to Open/Apply/Get)
  Event::Committed                  confirms a transaction was committed
  Event::Discarded                  confirms a transaction was discarded
```

### Named transactions

Editing the config happens inside a **named transaction**, held server-side in `nos-config`, not tied to any one connection. `OpenTransaction` creates it from a blank config or a clone of the running config (`TransactionBase::Blank`/`Current`), or — if a transaction with that name already exists — resumes its current in-progress state unchanged. `CommitTransaction` validates the transaction and, if valid, atomically replaces the running config and broadcasts it to every `Subscribe`d connection (the same fan-out `Get`/`Subscribe` already use); on invalid input the transaction is left alive so the caller can keep editing. `DiscardTransaction` deletes it outright. Because transactions live only in the daemon and are addressed by name, a client can disconnect (crash, Ctrl-C, network drop) and resume the same transaction later from a fresh connection — see `nos-cli`'s `configure <name>` command.

### Config plane vs data plane

| Plane | Transport | Pattern |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Config (this work) | Unix socket + postcard | Request/subscribe |
| Data (future, e.g. BGP→RIB routes) | Unix socket + postcard | High-frequency streaming |

Both planes use the same transport stack. The data plane will use a separate socket path and separate message types defined in `nos-proto`.

## Development

```bash
make check   # build + fmt + clippy + test (matches CI's fast jobs)
make fix     # auto-fix formatting and clippy-fixable lints
make help    # list all available targets
```

Containerized test environment:

```bash
make docker-build                        # build the nos-configd/nos Docker image
docker compose up -d configd             # run the daemon in a container
docker compose run --rm cli              # interactive shell, as its own container, sharing configd's socket
```

`configd` and `cli` share the same image and an `nos-run` volume mounted at `/run/nos`, so `cli` reaches the daemon over the same Unix socket path both binaries default to. `configd` also gets an `nos-data` volume at `/var/lib/nos` so `save`d config survives container restarts. `docker compose exec configd nos` still works too — it just runs the shell inside the daemon's own container instead of a separate one.

Or run the underlying commands directly:

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all
```
