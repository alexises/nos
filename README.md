# NOS — a network operating system built from scratch in Rust

NOS is a multi-process router operating system: one OS process per routing
protocol/component (BGP, OSPF, OSPFv3, LACP, LLDP, EVPN/VXLAN forwarding,
interface/RIB reconciliation, ...), talking over mutually authenticated
**post-quantum** TLS Unix-socket IPC, applying reconciled state to a real
Linux kernel (`rtnetlink`, VRFs, bridges, bonds, VXLAN). `nos-watchdogd`
supervises every other process and is also the internal certificate
authority.

Full architecture, protocol internals, and the reasoning behind every design
choice live in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — this file only orients a human and
gets a router running. It deliberately does not repeat what's in there.

## Features

- **BGP-4** (RFC 4271): RFC 2385 (MD5) / RFC 5925 (TCP-AO) session auth,
  RFC 5082 GTSM, RFC 4456 route reflection, RFC 7947 route-server
  transparency, RFC 6793 four-octet ASNs, RFC 7606 error handling,
  MRAI pacing, route flap damping.
- **EVPN/VXLAN** (RFC 7432): Type-1/2/3/4 routes, multi-homing with DF
  election, MAC mobility, nexthop-group aliasing.
- **OSPFv2** (RFC 2328) and **OSPFv3** (RFC 5340): Hello/DBD/LSR/LSU/LSAck,
  DR/BDR election, SPF + LFA (RFC 5286) backup paths, ABR/ASBR, RFC 5709 /
  RFC 7166 (RFC 7474) authentication.
- **LACP** (IEEE 802.1AX) and **LLDP** (IEEE 802.1AB), each a real
  from-scratch protocol implementation over raw `AF_PACKET` sockets.
- **RPL** — an imperative routing-policy language for BGP import/export
  filtering (community/AS-path/prefix-list matching and rewriting).
- **REST API** (`nos-restd`) with a generated OpenAPI document and Swagger
  UI, config-tree-as-URL transactions, mutual TLS.
- **Post-quantum mutual TLS everywhere** (`nos-pki`): hybrid ML-KEM key
  exchange, ML-DSA-65 IPC certificates, no classical fallback.

See `CLAUDE.md`'s component table for the full list, including static
routing, VLAN switching/SVIs, port aggregation, and structured log
collection.

## Quick start

Requires Docker.

```sh
make docker-build                 # build the nos image
docker compose up -d watchdog     # start the router (nos-watchdogd + its daemons)
docker compose run --rm cli       # interactive shell, against the running router
```

The shell prompts `login:`/`password:`. On first boot with no configured
users it seeds `admin`/`admin` — change it (see `CLAUDE.md`'s "User
authentication").

## A minimal config example

```
configure test
edit bgp instance my-instance
set asn 65000
set router-id 1.1.1.1
top
commit
show bgp brief
```

User documentation (concepts, the `nos` shell, the REST API and how they map to each other) is in [`docs/`](docs/README.md).
See [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md) for the full command reference.

## Development

```sh
make check   # build + fmt + clippy + test — run before pushing
make help    # list every Make target (deny, audit, sast, miri, coverage, mutants, ...)
```

Everything here only proves the pure logic is correct. Features that touch
a real kernel or a real multi-daemon IPC round trip are verified against
real Docker containers instead:

```sh
cargo run -p nos-e2e -- up established   # bring up two routers, wait for BGP to establish
cargo run -p nos-e2e -- all              # every verification phase (see tools/e2e)
```

`tools/bench-bgp.sh` benchmarks `nos-bgpd` against GoBGP/BIRD/FRR on the
same load. See `CLAUDE.md`'s "Development" section for CI details and the
rest of the tooling.

## Status

Actively developed. Every protocol feature is verified against real Docker
containers and a real Linux kernel by `nos-e2e` (see "Development" above),
not unit tests alone — this is not a claim of production-readiness.
