# Spanning tree

Spanning tree (IEEE 802.1Q clause 13) keeps an L2 topology loop-free.

- **`mode rstp`, `mode mstp` and `mode rapid-pvst` run.** `nos-stpd` speaks them on every physical interface or port aggregate that has a `switching-profile`; `disabled` leaves the daemon idle.
- Pick the mode by the network: `rstp` for one tree, `mstp` for a few trees shared with other vendors, `rapid-pvst` to meet Cisco switches that run a tree per VLAN. All three need the same mode on both ends.
- **Fail-safe:** with a mode other than `disabled`, a new bridge port starts blocked and BPDUs are trapped until `nos-stpd` pushes a state (see [STP internals](../internals/stp.md#kernel-side-nos-interfaced-326)). Set `spanning-tree mode disabled` to forward without spanning tree.
- Everything is checked at commit time.
- A port aggregate with an `esi` needs a guard profile (see [ESI port aggregates](#esi-port-aggregates)).

## Enable it and pick the root

```
set spanning-tree mode rstp
set spanning-tree priority 4096
```

- `rstp` is the default mode. Both switches need it; the lowest priority (then lowest bridge MAC) becomes the root.
- Set the priority on the bridge you want as root. Leave the rest at 32768.
- Without spanning tree, two parallel links between two switches in one broadcast domain are a loop: broadcasts circulate forever. With it, one link is blocked until the other fails.

## Read the state

```
show spanning-tree
```

- Prints the bridge id, the root id (and the root port and path cost, or "this bridge is the root"), the timers, then one row per port: `Name Role State Cost Prio Designated`.
- REST: `GET /v1/spanning-tree` (same data as JSON; `enabled: false` and no ports when the mode is neither `rstp` nor `mstp`). Add `detail` for counters and topology changes (below).
- `nos-stpd is not running` means the daemon is down; `spanning-tree is disabled` means the mode is neither `rstp` nor `mstp`.

| Role | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `root` | The port toward the root bridge; at most one per non-root bridge |
| `designated` | The port that sends the best BPDUs on its segment |
| `alternate` | A backup path to the root through another bridge; takes over within about a second on a point-to-point link |
| `backup` | A second port of this bridge on a segment it already serves |
| `disabled` | No carrier, or not usable |

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `discarding` | No learning, no forwarding (the kernel's blocking) |
| `learning` | Learns source MACs, does not forward |
| `forwarding` | Normal operation |

- `Designated` is the bridge id and port id (`priority.number`) the segment is led by; `-` for a disabled port.
- A port is discarding right after start-up or a topology change, until the handshake with its neighbour finishes (about a second between RSTP switches, up to `2 * forward-delay` toward a legacy STP one).

## Read the detail

```
show spanning-tree detail
show spanning-tree instance 5 detail
show spanning-tree domain bd5 detail
```

- Each prints the table of the plain command, then `topology changes <n>, last change <s>s ago via <port> (local|received)` (or `no change yet`) and one block per port: `edge` and `point-to-point` as the protocol sees them now, the port's flags, and the counters below. In `rapid-pvst`, `show spanning-tree detail` lists every tree.
- REST: `GET /v1/spanning-tree` (and the `instance`/`domain` paths) already carry `topology` (`count`, `last_secs_ago`, `last_port`, `last_cause`) and, per port, `edge`, `point_to_point` and `counters`. `GET /v1/spanning-tree/counters` is the flat form for scripts: one row `{tree, port, counters}` per port, `tree` being `cist` or, in `rapid-pvst`, the domain name.
- Counters start at zero when `nos-stpd` builds the bridge (start, or any spanning-tree config change) and are per port: in `mstp` the MSTIs share the CIST's, since one BPDU carries them all.
- A topology change is counted once per episode: a neighbour repeats the flag in every hello for a while, and that is one change. `local` means a port of this bridge started forwarding; `received` means a neighbour's TC flag or TCN BPDU came in on `last_port`.

| Counter (`counters`) | RFC 4318 object | Counts |
|---|---|---|
| `in_config_bpdu`, `out_config_bpdu` | `dot1dStpPortInConfigBpdu`, `...OutConfigBpdu` | 802.1D Config BPDUs received, sent |
| `in_tcn_bpdu`, `out_tcn_bpdu` | `...InTcnBpdu`, `...OutTcnBpdu` | 802.1D TCN BPDUs |
| `in_rstp_bpdu`, `out_rstp_bpdu` | `...InRstpBpdu`, `...OutRstpBpdu` | RST BPDUs (version 2) |
| `in_mst_bpdu`, `out_mst_bpdu` | `...InMstBpdu`, `...OutMstBpdu` | MST BPDUs (version 3) |
| `tc_sent`, `tc_received` | `...TcSent`, `...TcReceived` | BPDUs with the topology-change flag, plus TCNs |
| `protocol_migration` | `...ProtocolMigration` | Switches between 802.1D and RSTP |
| `invalid_bpdu` | `...InvalidBpdu` | Frames dropped as malformed |
| `forward_transitions` | `...ForwardTransitions` | Times the port entered forwarding |

## Log lines

Field values follow the message in the order shown. The strings are frozen by a unit test (`stp/src/events.rs`); change one only together with the e2e phase.

| `spanning tree state machines did not reach quiescence` | (error) | A bug in the state machines; report it |

## Troubleshoot

- **A port is discarding but should forward.** `show spanning-tree detail`: if `Flags` says `Root-inconsistent` or `Loop-inconsistent`, a guard holds it; read `Designated` to see which bridge outranks this one on the segment. A port with `Err-disabled` needs `clear spanning-tree err-disabled <if>`. Otherwise it is an alternate or backup port on purpose: the other link of a loop.
- **Topology changes keep coming.** Watch `topology change` lines: `cause=local` on a port that flaps means the link or the host behind it flaps, so make a host port `edge-port admin` (edge ports never cause a change); `cause=received` on the same `port` means the cause is behind that neighbour. `restricted-tcn` stops a neighbour's changes at that port.
- **MAC tables flush all the time.** Same cause: each change flushes the learned MACs of the affected ports (of the affected domains in `mstp` and `rapid-pvst`).
- **Two switches do not share MST instances.** Compare `show spanning-tree mst-config` on both: name, revision and digest must be equal; `mst boundary port ... reason=` names the first difference.
- **Rapid-PVST+ port blocked in one VLAN only.** `pvid inconsistent` in the log: the peer's trunk names another VLAN for that tag, or the native VLAN differs.
- **A port sticks to 802.1D.** `show spanning-tree detail` shows `in: config` growing: a legacy peer or a bridge forcing STP is on the segment. After it is fixed, `clear spanning-tree detected-protocols`.
- **No BPDUs at all.** `in: ...` stays zero: the link is down, the port has no `switching-profile`, or the peer filters BPDUs (`bpdu-filter`).
- **An ESI aggregate must be an edge port with a guard.** A VXLAN device is never a spanning-tree port, only physical interfaces and port aggregates are; see [ESI port aggregates](#esi-port-aggregates).

## Configure the bridge

```
set spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
set spanning-tree priority 4096
set spanning-tree hello-time 2
set spanning-tree max-age 20
set spanning-tree forward-delay 15
```

- `mode` is `rstp` (default), `mstp`, `rapid-pvst` or `disabled`.
- The REST equivalent of each line is `PUT /v1/transactions/<tx>/spanning-tree/<field>` (see [CLI ↔ API mapping](../cli-api-mapping.md)); enum bodies are the variant name, e.g. `"RapidPvst"`.
- An old `config.yaml` without a `spanning_tree` key loads with the defaults.

## Define a port profile

```
edit stp-port-profile edge
set edge-port admin
set bpdu-guard
```

- Attach it with `set interface <if> stp-port-profile edge` or `set port-aggregate <pa> stp-port-profile edge`.
- Only an interface with a `switching-profile` is a spanning-tree port. On another one the attachment is kept but unused, so the edit order stays free.
- An interface that is a member of a port aggregate cannot carry its own profile: the spanning-tree port is the aggregate.
- `delete stp-port-profile <name>` is refused at commit while an interface or aggregate still names it; each user fails under its own path.

## Protect a port

Set the protections on the `stp-port-profile` of the port.

```
edit stp-port-profile edge
set edge-port admin
set bpdu-guard enable
set bpdu-guard-recovery 300
```

| Protection | Use it on | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `bpdu-guard` | A port to a host (an edge port, `admin` or detected by `auto`) | The first BPDU received shuts the link down (err-disabled) |
| `bpdu-guard-recovery <s>` | With `bpdu-guard` | The link comes back after `s` seconds; unset means only `clear` or removing the guard brings it back |
| `root-guard` | A port toward a switch that must never become the root | A superior BPDU makes the port alternate and discarding (root-inconsistent) for as long as it keeps arriving |
| `loop-guard` | A root or alternate port on a point-to-point link | When BPDUs stop arriving the port stays discarding (loop-inconsistent) instead of turning designated |
| `bpdu-filter` | A port that must stay silent | No BPDU is sent and none is processed |
| `restricted-tcn` | A port toward a switch you do not trust | A topology change received on it is not propagated to the other ports |

- `bpdu-guard` fires on any port that is an edge port at that moment: `edge-port admin`, or `auto` once no BPDU was heard for a few seconds. A port with `edge-port disabled` is never guarded.
- `bpdu-filter` on a port that is not an edge port can create a loop: both sides stop hearing each other and forward. Use it on edge ports only.
- A commit is refused for `root-guard` with `loop-guard`, `bpdu-filter` with `bpdu-guard`, and `bpdu-guard-recovery` without `bpdu-guard`.
- Loop guard clears when a BPDU arrives again or when the link goes down and up.

### Read and recover

- `show spanning-tree` adds a `Flags` column when a port has any: `Edge`, `BpduGuard`, `BpduFilter`, `RootGuard`, `LoopGuard`, `RestrictedTcn`, then what holds the port now: `Root-inconsistent`, `Loop-inconsistent`, `Err-disabled (recovers in 12s)` or `Err-disabled (manual clear)`. `GET /v1/spanning-tree` has the same fields per port.
- Logs: `port err-disabled port=<if> reason=bpdu-guard`, `port err-disabled recovered`, `port root-inconsistent` / `port root-consistent`, `port loop-inconsistent` / `port loop-consistent`.
- Recover an err-disabled port at once with `clear spanning-tree err-disabled <if>` (REST: `POST /v1/spanning-tree/port/<if>/err-disabled/clear`). It answers an error if the port is not err-disabled. If the BPDU source is still there the port is shut again.
- Removing `bpdu-guard` from the profile also brings the port back. Other config changes, and a restart of `nos-stpd`, keep an err-disabled port down; after a restart the recovery timer starts again from its full `bpdu-guard-recovery`.
- An err-disabled link is administratively down: LLDP and LACP on it stop too. Never put the guard on the interface that carries management traffic.

## Use MSTP

```
set spanning-tree mode mstp
set spanning-tree region name lab
set spanning-tree region revision 1
set spanning-tree mst-instance 5 priority 8192
set broadcast domain bd5 stp-instance 5
set stp-port-profile edge mst-instance 5 cost 100
```

- An instance must exist under `spanning-tree mst-instance` before a broadcast domain or a port profile names it. At most 64 instances, ids 1-4094.
- A domain with no `stp-instance` stays in the CIST (instance 0).
- Every switch of one region needs the same `region name`, `region revision` and VLAN to instance map, or its ports toward the others are boundary ports (below).

### Map domains to instances

- A domain's VLAN is the dot1q tag of its switching-profile membership; a domain that is only untagged is VLAN 1. The instance is its `stp-instance`.
- `nos-stpd` derives the 4096-entry VLAN to instance table from that and hashes it into the MST configuration digest (802.1Q 13.8). Two switches share instances only when name, revision and digest all match.
- Every VLAN no domain uses maps to the CIST. A peer that maps extra VLANs to an instance gets a different digest; there is no explicit VLAN-range override, so give such a peer the same domains.
- Changing a domain's tag or `stp-instance` changes the digest and restarts the protocol, which is a region change for the peers: change every switch of the region in the same maintenance window.

### Read it and compare with a peer

```
show spanning-tree mst-config
show spanning-tree instance 5
```

- `mst-config` prints the region name, revision, digest (32 hex digits) and, per instance, the VLANs and domains. Compare the digest with the peer's: equal digests and equal name and revision mean one region.
- `instance <n>` prints the instance's bridge id, root (and root port and cost) and one row per port with role and state; a `Boundary` mark means the peer is outside the region and the port follows the CIST. `instance 0` is the CIST.
- REST: `GET /v1/spanning-tree/instance/<n>` and `GET /v1/spanning-tree/mst-config` (`404` when the mode is not `mstp` or the instance does not exist). `GET /v1/spanning-tree` also carries the `mst` object.
- Logs: `mst configuration` (once per start), `mst region match port=<if>` and `mst boundary port port=<if> reason=<plain-bpdu|name|revision|digest>` (once per change), `msti port role changed` and `msti port state changed port=<if> msti=<n> state=<s> domains=<list>`.

### What the kernel gets

- The state of a domain's bridge port is the state of the tree its `stp-instance` names. Instance 5 blocking `eth1` blocks `eth1.<tag>` of the domains in instance 5 and leaves the other domains on `eth1` forwarding, so two parallel links can each carry different VLANs.
- Domains without an instance, and untagged-only domains in the CIST, follow the CIST state of the physical link or bond.
- A topology change in an instance flushes only that instance's domains.

### Boundary ports

- A port is a boundary port when its peer is an RSTP or STP bridge, or an MST bridge of another region (name, revision or digest differs). The instances do not run there: every instance takes the CIST state of the port.
- Toward an RSTP peer `nos-stpd` still sends a version 3 BPDU, which RSTP reads as its CIST part; toward a legacy 802.1D peer the port migrates to STP as in [Interoperate with an 802.1D switch](#interoperate-with-an-8021d-switch) and sends Config BPDUs.
- A port leaves the boundary state when a BPDU of the same region arrives, or when the link goes down.

### Limits

- The CIST is one flat tree across regions: the external and internal root path costs are summed and the regional root is not tracked. Two NOS bridges, or one region of NOS bridges behind an RSTP core, behave correctly; mixing with another vendor's MSTP regions can pick a different root port than a full 802.1Q implementation would.
- `restricted-tcn`, root guard, loop guard and BPDU guard act on the CIST only; BPDU filter silences all instances.
- A per-instance port cost defaults to the CIST cost of the port (profile `cost`, else the link speed); `mst-instance <n> cost` overrides it for that instance.
- `max-hops` (default 20) is the remaining-hops budget of an instance's information; an instance's information from a bridge `max-hops` away is discarded.

## Use Rapid-PVST+

```
set spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
set broadcast domain bd5 stp-priority 4096
set broadcast domain bd5 stp-hello-time 1
set switching-profile trunk member bd5 stp-cost 200
```

- Every broadcast domain used by a switching profile is its own spanning tree (one RSTP instance per VLAN), so each VLAN can have another root and block another link. Its VLAN is the dot1q tag of the member; a domain that is only untagged is VLAN 1.
- `stp-priority`, `stp-hello-time`, `stp-max-age` and `stp-forward-delay` on a domain override the global value for that VLAN; unset inherits. The bridge id of a tree is the priority plus the VLAN (priority 4096, VLAN 10 is `100a`).
- Per switching profile member, `stp-cost <n>` and `stp-priority <n>` tune the port in that VLAN only; unset falls back to the port's `stp-port-profile`, then the link speed. Use the cost on the non-root side to choose which link a VLAN blocks.
- `stp-port-profile` settings (edge, guards, link type) apply to the port in every tree. Port protections act per tree: a BPDU guard fires on the first BPDU of any VLAN.
- A port takes part in a tree only if the domain is a member of its switching profile. The kernel gets each tree's state on that domain's own bridge port, so VLAN 10 can block `eth1.10` while `eth1.20` forwards.
- A topology change in one VLAN flushes only that domain's learned MACs.

### Native VLAN

- The domain that is untagged on a port is its native VLAN. Its BPDUs travel on the link itself, in the Cisco SSTP form and also in the IEEE form (`01:80:c2:00:00:00`), which is what a plain 802.1Q neighbour understands.
- Tagged domains send SSTP on `ethX.<tag>` only, and an IEEE BPDU received there is ignored.

### PVID inconsistency

- An SSTP BPDU carries the sender's VLAN. When it names another VLAN than the tree it arrived in, the port is blocked in that tree and the daemon logs `pvid inconsistent domain=<bd> port=<if> expected=<vid> got=<vid>` once.
- The block is lifted by the next consistent BPDU, or after three hellos without any BPDU (log `pvid consistent`). The BPDU is not given to the tree's state machines meanwhile.
- `show spanning-tree domain <bd>` marks such a port `PVID-inconsistent`.

### Read it

```
show spanning-tree
show spanning-tree domain bd5
```

- `show spanning-tree` lists one row per tree: domain, VLAN, root id and root port.
- `show spanning-tree domain <bd>` prints the tree's bridge id, root and one row per member port with role and state; `Compat` marks a port that talks 802.1D to its peer in this VLAN.
- REST: `GET /v1/spanning-tree/domain/<bd>` (`404` when the mode is not `rapid-pvst` or the domain has no tree); `GET /v1/spanning-tree` carries them all in `pvst`.
- Logs: `pvst port role changed domain=<bd> port=<if> role=<role>`, `pvst port state changed ...`, `pvst root bridge changed domain=<bd> root=<id>`.

### Interoperate with Cisco

- Peers running Rapid-PVST+ are met on `01:00:0c:cc:cc:cd` (SNAP PID `0x010b`) per VLAN. The trunk must carry the same VLAN tags and the same native VLAN on both ends.
- A peer running plain PVST+ (non-rapid) in some VLAN sends Config BPDUs: the port migrates to 802.1D in that VLAN only, after Migrate Time, as in [Interoperate with an 802.1D switch](#interoperate-with-an-8021d-switch); other VLANs on the port stay RSTP. `clear spanning-tree detected-protocols` does not apply to Rapid-PVST+ yet.
- Limits: the lab has no Cisco switch, so the SSTP framing is checked against the layout of Wireshark's `packet-stp.c`, not against live traffic. The VLAN of a tree is always the dot1q tag (no separate native VLAN setting). A tagged member needs its `ethX.<tag>` sub-link up, so bring the parent link up first. Every tree sends its own hello on every member port, so CPU grows with domains times ports.

## Interoperate with an 802.1D switch

- By default (`force-version` unset or `rstp`) each port starts in RSTP and falls back to 802.1D on its own when it hears a Config or TCN BPDU. Log: `port migrated to STP port=<if>`.
- A port that fell back stays in STP: a peer that later turns to RSTP is noticed on its first RST BPDU and the port migrates back (`port migrated to RSTP`), but a peer that merely stops talking does not.
- `set spanning-tree force-version stp` makes every port send Config/TCN BPDUs only, whatever the peer does. The port states then use the legacy Listening and Learning delays (`forward-delay` each, 30 s by default); Listening is shown as `discarding`.
- `clear spanning-tree detected-protocols [interface <if>]` (REST: `POST /v1/spanning-tree/mcheck`, or `/v1/spanning-tree/port/<if>/mcheck`) is the standard's `mcheck`: ports go back to RSTP and migrate again after Migrate Time (3 s) if the peer still sends STP BPDUs. It answers with the number of ports it reached.
- A change of `force-version` restarts the protocol, like any spanning-tree setting.
- Expect convergence in tens of seconds, not sub-second, on a legacy segment. Lowering `forward-delay` (4 to 30 s) and `max-age` shortens it within the timer relation.

## ESI port aggregates

A multi-homed segment must never become a root or transit port of the spanning tree.

- While `spanning-tree mode` is not `disabled`, a port aggregate with an `esi` must name a profile with `edge-port admin` and `bpdu-guard`.
- `nos-provision --port-aggregate-esi` creates that profile (`esi-guard`) and attaches it for you.
- A saved config with an ESI aggregate and no such profile is refused at its next commit: add the profile, or set `spanning-tree mode disabled`.

## Commit checks

- **Timers** (802.1Q 13.25): `2 * (forward-delay - 1) >= max-age >= 2 * (hello-time + 1)`, checked on the global values and, for a domain that overrides any of them, on its effective set (its own value, else the global one).
- **Priorities:** bridge, MST instance and per-VLAN priorities are multiples of 4096 up to 61440; port priorities are multiples of 16 up to 240.
- **References:** an unknown profile, MST instance or deleted profile is refused.
- **Per-VLAN modes** (`mstp`, `rapid-pvst`): every domain used by an interface or aggregate switching profile must have one VLAN across all of them (an untagged-only membership is VLAN 1), and two domains may not share a VLAN. The error names the domain and both tags.
- **Protections:** `root-guard` with `loop-guard`, `bpdu-filter` with `bpdu-guard`, and `bpdu-guard-recovery` without `bpdu-guard` are refused.
- **Bond members:** `stp-port-profile` on an interface with `port-aggregate` set is refused.
- **ESI:** see [above](#esi-port-aggregates).

## Verify

- `show config` prints what is set; the transaction diff shows what a commit would change.
- `show spanning-tree` shows what the daemon computed (above); `show spanning-tree detail` adds the topology changes and counters.
