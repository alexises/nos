# Interfaces, subinterfaces and loopbacks

This page covers layer-3 interfaces: putting addresses on a physical interface or one of its VLANs, placing it in a routing table, setting its MTU, and giving a routing table a loopback. Bridging and VLAN trunking are on [L2 switching](l2-switching.md), bonds on [Port aggregation and LACP](port-aggregation-lacp.md), and LLDP on [LLDP](lldp.md).

## What an interface is in NOS

An `interface` in the configuration is one of two things:

- A **physical interface**, named exactly as the operating system names it (`eth0`, `eth1`, …). NOS does not create physical interfaces: the link must already exist on the router. Adding it to the configuration tells NOS to manage it: bring it up, apply its addresses and MTU, and attach it to its routing table.
- A **loopback**, named `loopback-<table>`, for example `loopback-rt1`. The name alone makes it a loopback, and says which routing table it belongs to. NOS creates the loopback device itself, and there is at most one per routing table. Loopbacks are the usual home for a router ID, a BGP source address or an EVPN VTEP address.

A physical interface carries its layer-3 configuration on **subinterfaces**, one per VLAN tag:

- Tag `0` is the untagged (native) part of the link. `eth0.0` is the interface itself, with no VLAN header.
- Tags `1` to `4094` are 802.1Q VLANs. `eth0.300` is VLAN 300 on `eth0`, and NOS creates the VLAN device for it.

Each subinterface has its own addresses and its own routing table, independently of the others. A loopback has no subinterfaces: its addresses and routing table sit directly on it.

Putting a subinterface or loopback in a routing table makes it a member of that table's VRF (see [Concepts: Routing tables are VRFs](concepts.md#routing-tables-are-vrfs)). Its addresses then appear in the table as connected routes. An address without a routing table is applied to the interface, but belongs to no routing table.

## Common operations

The examples use router-a from the lab described in the [README](README.md#conventions-used-in-these-pages), where `eth0.0` already has `10.50.0.2/24` in routing table `rt1`.

### Address a VLAN subinterface and put it in a routing table

```
router-a> configure vlan300
router-a(vlan300)> edit interface eth0.300
router-a(vlan300/interface:eth0.300)> set address 192.0.2.1/24
router-a(vlan300/interface:eth0.300)> set routing-table rt1
router-a(vlan300/interface:eth0.300)> top
router-a(vlan300)> diff
  interface eth0:
+   subinterface 300:
+     addresses: 192.0.2.1/24
+     routing-table: rt1
+     ospf-profile: unset
router-a(vlan300)> commit
transaction 'vlan300' committed
router-a> show interface eth0
interface eth0: address [none], routing-table unset, switching-profile unset, mtu 1500
  subinterface 0: address [10.50.0.2/24], routing-table rt1
  subinterface 300: address [192.0.2.1/24], routing-table rt1
router-a> show route rt1
10.50.0.0/24
  * via 10.50.0.2 [connected]
192.0.2.0/24
  * via 192.0.2.1 [connected]
```

`edit interface eth0.300` creates the subinterface (and the interface, if it is new). The absolute form does the same in one line per field: `set interface eth0.300 address 192.0.2.1/24` and `set interface eth0.300 routing-table rt1`. Without a `.<tag>`, an address or routing-table command applies to the untagged subinterface: `set interface eth1 address 192.0.2.1/24` configures `eth1.0`.

Over REST, a subinterface that does not exist yet is created by `PUT`ting it whole:

```sh
$ $C -X POST $B/v1/transactions/vlan300
$ $C -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"tag":300,"addresses":[{"address":"192.0.2.1/24","label":null}],"routing_table":"rt1"}' \
    $B/v1/transactions/vlan300/interface/eth0/subinterface/300
{"addresses":[{"address":"192.0.2.1/24","label":null}],"ospf_profile":null,"ospfv3_profile":null,"routing_table":"rt1","tag":300}
$ $C -X POST $B/v1/transactions/vlan300/commit
{"committed":"vlan300"}
$ $C $B/v1/interfaces/eth0 | jq -c '.subinterfaces[]'
{"tag":0,"addresses":[{"address":"10.50.0.2/24","label":null}],"routing_table":"rt1","link_local_address":"fe80::306e:68ff:fed3:69b8"}
{"tag":300,"addresses":[{"address":"192.0.2.1/24","label":null}],"routing_table":"rt1","link_local_address":"fe80::306e:68ff:fed3:69b8"}
```

Once the subinterface exists, one address is added or removed by its own URL: `PUT …/interface/eth0/subinterface/300/address/198.51.100.1%2F24` with body `{"address":"198.51.100.1/24","label":null}`, and `DELETE` on the same URL.

### Remove a subinterface

```
router-a> configure novlan
router-a(novlan)> delete interface eth0.300
router-a(novlan)> commit
transaction 'novlan' committed
```

REST: `DELETE $B/v1/transactions/novlan/interface/eth0/subinterface/300`, then commit. NOS deletes the VLAN device. `delete interface eth0` (no tag) removes the whole interface from the configuration: NOS then removes the addresses, VLAN devices and routing-table membership it had applied, and stops managing the link.

### Add a loopback to a routing table

```
router-a> configure lo
router-a(lo)> edit interface loopback-rt1
router-a(lo/interface:loopback-rt1)> set address 203.0.113.1/32
router-a(lo/interface:loopback-rt1)> set routing-table rt1
router-a(lo/interface:loopback-rt1)> commit
transaction 'lo' committed
router-a> show interface loopback-rt1
interface loopback-rt1: address [203.0.113.1/32], routing-table rt1, switching-profile unset, mtu 1500
router-a> show route rt1 203.0.113.1
203.0.113.1/32
  * via 203.0.113.1 [connected]
```

The name alone puts the loopback in routing table `rt1`, which must exist when you commit. Set `routing-table rt1` as well, to the same table: without it the loopback still works, but its addresses are not listed as connected routes in `show route`, and OSPF refuses to run on it. You can add several addresses, IPv4 and IPv6. The loopback device NOS creates is named after the routing table's kernel table number (`lo100` for the first routing table), not after `loopback-rt1`; you only need that name when looking at the router with Linux tools.

REST:

```sh
$ $C -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"name":"loopback-rt1","addresses":[{"address":"203.0.113.1/32","label":null}],"routing_table":"rt1","subinterfaces":[]}' \
    $B/v1/transactions/lo/interface/loopback-rt1
$ $C -X POST $B/v1/transactions/lo/commit
```

Deleting it (`delete interface loopback-rt1`, or `DELETE …/interface/loopback-rt1`) deletes the loopback device.

### Set the MTU

```
router-a> configure jumbo
router-a(jumbo)> set interface eth0 mtu 9000
router-a(jumbo)> commit
transaction 'jumbo' committed
router-a> show interface eth0
interface eth0: address [none], routing-table unset, switching-profile unset, mtu 9000
  subinterface 0: address [10.50.0.2/24], routing-table rt1
```

REST: `PUT $B/v1/transactions/jumbo/interface/eth0/mtu` with body `9000`, then commit.

The MTU belongs to the link, so it is set on `eth0`, never on `eth0.300`; every subinterface uses the link's MTU. `set interface eth0.300 mtu …` is refused (`interface 'eth0.300' not found`), and so is `set mtu` while in `edit interface eth0.300`.

`delete interface eth0 mtu` (REST: `DELETE …/interface/eth0/mtu`) stops NOS from managing the MTU, but it does **not** put the old value back: the link keeps 9000 until something changes it, even though `show interface` then prints `mtu 1500` (see below). To return to 1500, set 1500.

## How interfaces behave

**NOS owns what you configure, and only that.** Interfaces that are not in the configuration are left alone. On an interface that is, the configured addresses are the complete list: NOS adds the missing ones and removes any other address it finds, except IPv6 link-local addresses, which it never touches. A configured interface is always brought up. There is no `shutdown` for an interface.

**Names.** An interface name is 1 to 64 characters and cannot contain `.`, which is reserved for the `<interface>.<tag>` form. A name starting with `loopback-` is a loopback, and the rest of the name must be an existing routing table.

**Addresses.** A subinterface or loopback can carry any number of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, written as `<address>/<prefix length>`. The same address cannot appear twice on one subinterface; this is checked at commit. `set … address <addr> label <label>` attaches a label to the address. The label is kept in the configuration and shown by `show this`, but it is not applied to the router's network stack yet. Setting the same address again with a different label, or without one, replaces the label.

**Routing tables.** Many interfaces, subinterfaces and loopbacks can be in the same routing table. The addresses of a subinterface or loopback with a `routing-table` show up in that table as `connected` routes (see `show route <table>`), a few seconds after the commit; BGP uses them to decide whether a next hop is reachable.

**What can share a link.** Linux lets each link, and each VLAN device, have only one master: a VRF, a bridge or a bond. The commit therefore refuses:

- a subinterface whose tag is also used by the interface's switching profile (an untagged member uses tag 0, a `dot1q <n>` member tag `n`; see [L2 switching](l2-switching.md#untagged-members-and-subinterfaces));
- an interface that is a member of a port aggregate and also has subinterfaces or a switching profile (see [Port aggregation and LACP](port-aggregation-lacp.md));
- `address`, `routing-table` or `ospf` set directly on a physical interface rather than on a subinterface. The CLI never does this (a bare `eth0` means `eth0.0`), but a REST body could.

**`show interface` shows the configuration NOS is applying,** not a live read of the kernel. Right after a commit, or while a routing table's VRF is still being created, the two can differ for a few seconds; NOS retries every 10 seconds until they match. `mtu` is the configured MTU, or `1500` when none is configured, whatever the link really has.

**OSPF and OSPFv3** are enabled per subinterface or loopback with `set interface <name> ospf <profile>` and `set interface <name> ospfv3 <profile>`, which require a routing table on the same subinterface. They are covered with the OSPF configuration they refer to.

## Configuration reference

In the tables, `<if>` is a physical interface name, `<if>.<tag>` a subinterface, and `<lo>` a loopback name (`loopback-<table>`). Every REST path starts with `/v1/transactions/{tx}/`. The relative CLI form is the one you type after `edit interface <if>`, `edit interface <if>.<tag>` or `edit interface <lo>`. The `show` column says how to check the result; `show this` works everywhere in configuration mode.

A loopback cannot have subinterfaces, a switching profile, a port aggregate or LLDP.
