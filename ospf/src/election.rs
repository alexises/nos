//! RFC 2328 §9.4 DR/BDR election — pure, synchronous, no I/O. Mirrors
//! `neighbor.rs`'s/`packet.rs`'s pure-core style; `link.rs` drives real
//! Hello send/receive and timers around this.
//!
//! # ponytail: single-pass election
//! RFC 2328 §9.4 says to recompute DR/BDR a second time if the first pass
//! changed *this router's own* role (Backup/DR/DROther) — a stability
//! refinement. This is skipped: `elect` always runs a single pass.
//! `link.rs` re-runs `elect` after every Hello-driven neighbor-state change
//! and every dead-interval sweep, so the correct steady state is still
//! reached, just within one extra Hello interval instead of instantly.
//! Harmless here since no neighbor ever progresses past `TwoWay` regardless
//! of DR/BDR-ness this phase (see `ospf/CLAUDE.md`) — upgrade to a second
//! pass if adjacency formation ever depends on DR/BDR-ness.
