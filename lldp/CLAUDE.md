# nos-lldp — LLDP (IEEE 802.1AB) Daemon

A real, from-scratch Link Layer Discovery Protocol implementation for NOS (binary `nos-lldpd`, a single fixed process — see `docs/architecture/supervision.md`; same reasoning as `nos-lacpd`/`nos-interfaced`/`nos-logd`: LLDP has no per-VRF/per-instance multiplicity to key a dynamic per-object spawn off).

## Scope

`nos-lldpd` runs one raw `AF_PACKET` socket per LLDP-enabled **physical** interface, transmitting this system's identity and recording the neighbors it hears. It **never touches rtnetlink** and owns no kernel state — `nos-interfaced` already brings every configured physical interface admin-up, which is all LLDP needs. It has `CAP_NET_RAW` only. It exists as its own daemon (rather than a module of `nos-interfaced`) because it parses untrusted frames from the wire: a bug in a decoder should not take down interface reconciliation.

Config is two independent booleans on `Interface` (`lldp_transmit`, `lldp_receive`, both off by default, physical interfaces only — `valid_lldp_physical_only` rejects them on a `loopback-*` interface at commit time). CLI: `set|delete interface <name> lldp transmit|receive`, `show lldp neighbors [detail]` and `show lldp statistics`. A member of a `PortAggregate` is an ordinary `Interface`, so LLDP runs on the physical members, never on the bond device (as the standard requires).

Four more knobs, none of which enable LLDP by themselves:

- **Timers** (system-wide, `Config.lldp`, `nos_proto::LldpSettings`): `set lldp tx-interval <secs>` (`msgTxInterval`, 1–3600, default 30) and `set lldp tx-hold <n>` (`msgTxHold`, 1–100, default 4). The advertised TTL is `hold × interval` (default 120s) and `LldpSettings::check` rejects a product over 65535, since the TTL field is 16 bits and the two ranges alone allow 360000. The daemon reads them through `LldpSettings::effective_*`, the same helpers the validator uses.
- **Management addresses** (system-wide, `LldpSettings.management_addresses`): `set lldp management-address <ip>` adds one, `delete lldp management-address <ip>` removes one. Up to `MAX_MANAGEMENT_ADDRESSES` (4, in `nos-proto` so the sender's and receiver's caps are the same number) unique IPv4/IPv6 unicast addresses, each in its own TLV on every LLDP-enabled link. Taken as configured, never checked against kernel state at commit. A config saved before the list existed (`management_address: <ip>`) still loads, via a serde alias plus a scalar-or-list deserializer.
- **System Description** (system-wide, `LldpSettings.system_description`): `set lldp system-description <text>`, 1-255 bytes, no control characters, default `nos` (never a version). Part of `LinkConfig`, so a change restarts the links.
- **Destination group** (per interface, `Interface.lldp_destination`): `set interface <name> lldp destination nearest-bridge|non-tpmr|customer-bridge` → `01:80:C2:00:00:{0E,03,00}`. Physical interfaces only, like the on/off flags.

A change to any of these restarts the affected links (`LinkConfig` equality): a shutdown LLDPDU, then a fresh advertisement, so neighbors briefly drop and relearn. Not worth an in-place timer hot-swap.

## Decode robustness

`packet::decode` is the one place untrusted bytes are parsed. It bounds-checks every TLV length, requires the first three TLVs to be Chassis ID, Port ID and TTL in order (and rejects a repeat of them), skips unknown TLVs, ignores anything after the End TLV (Ethernet padding), and never panics. The Management Address TLV is optional and untrusted, so a truncated, internally inconsistent, or non-IP one is *skipped* rather than rejecting the whole LLDPDU (which would hide the neighbor), and at most `MAX_MANAGEMENT_ADDRESSES` (4) are kept per LLDPDU since every one is stored and printed. Free-text TLVs (Port Description, System Name/Description) have control characters replaced at decode time (`packet::lossy`), since they are printed into `nos-cli` output and logs and a neighbor is untrusted — an ANSI escape sequence or carriage return must not reach an operator's terminal; Chassis/Port IDs go through the same check in `text_or_hex`. Org-specific TLVs (`packet::decode_org`) follow the Management Address rule: a known one (802.1 PVID/VLAN Name/Link Aggregation, 802.3 MAC/PHY/Max Frame Size, and the deprecated 802.3 Link Aggregation, `00-12-0F`/3, decoded into the same field) that is the wrong length or a repeat of a single-instance TLV is skipped and counted as `tlvs_discarded` (the first copy wins), VLAN Names are capped at `MAX_VLAN_NAMES` (32) and go through `lossy`; an unknown OUI/subtype is `tlvs_unrecognized`. Each rejection path has a unit test.

## Explicitly deferred (documented, not silently missing)

- **LLDP-MED / DCBX / other organizationally-specific TLVs** (received ones are skipped, never stored). NOS has no voice VLAN, PoE, location or QoS/PFC/ETS feature for them to describe, so nothing could honestly be advertised.
- **Port VLAN ID and 802.3 MAC/PHY transmit** — decoded only, see "What is sent" in [internals](../docs/internals/lldp.md).
- **Several destination groups per interface** — one group each, chosen in config.


## Behavior that bites

- A stopping `transmit` link sends a TTL-0 shutdown LLDPDU (`shutdown_pdu`, not credit-gated): neighbors drop at once, which `nos-e2e lldp` depends on.
- Fast start (802.1AB §9.2.5.19-21) and `txCredit` (`TX_CREDIT_MAX` 5, +1/s) bound transmits; only a `New` neighbor restarts a burst, so two systems settle.
- `handle_rx` logs `neighbor learned`/shutdown `removed` at `info` only while the link's `LogBucket` has a credit (burst 5, +1 per 10s), else `debug`; the table is never affected.
- Neighbor identity is (chassis id, port id); `NeighborTable` is capped at `MAX_NEIGHBORS_PER_LINK` (32), since input is untrusted.
- Own frames are dropped twice (source MAC in `socket::payload_of_foreign_frame`, own chassis id in `link::handle_rx`); a down link is retried (`LINK_DOWN_RETRY` 1s), never fatal; never leave an elapsed deadline armed (as in `nos-lacp`).
- The chassis MAC is derived (FNV-1a of hostname + machine-id, `reconcile::local_system_id`, `ponytail:` collision caveat as in `nos-lacp`).
- Destination group is one per interface; a different group on each end never sees the other.
